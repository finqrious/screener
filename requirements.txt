# Optional: if you intend to run in environments where Chromedriver is not pre-installed
# and want to ensure it's fetched correctly. webdriver-manager handles this.

# No specific versions are pinned, which means the latest compatible versions will be installed.
# For production, it's often better to pin versions after testing, e.g.:
# streamlit==1.20.0
# requests==2.28.1
# beautifulsoup4==4.11.1
# selenium==4.8.0
# webdriver-manager==3.8.5
